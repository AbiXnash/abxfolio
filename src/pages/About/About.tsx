			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				Hey there! I'm a final-year student pretending to have my life together while juggling code, cofee and deadlines.
				I specialize in AI/ML and full stack developoment -- basically, I teach machines to be smart while I figure out life.
				While I'm not coding, I'm probably reading "The Alchemist" or convincing myself that I'm a good cook.
				If you're here looking for brilliance, welcome aboard! If you're here to hire me, I'm flattered.
			</p>
